# Text-Classification

1. Create your own dataset for text classification. It should contain at least 1000 words in total and at least two categories with at least 100 examples per category. You can create it by scraping the web or using some of the documents you have on your computer (do not use anything confidential) or ChatGPT. [15 points]
2. Split the dataset into training (at least 160examples) and test (at least 40 examples) sets. [5 points]
3. Fine tune a pretrained language model capable of generating text (e.g., GPT) that you can take from the Hugging Face Transformers library with the dataset your created (this tutorial could be very helpful: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training). Report the test accuracy. Discuss what could be done to improve accuracy. [30 points]
